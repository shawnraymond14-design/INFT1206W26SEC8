    <h1>Re: Eileen Dover university application</h1>

    <p>Dear <strong>Eileen</strong>,</p>

    <p>
        Thank you for your recent application to join us at the University of Awesome's
        science faculty to study as part of your
        <abbr title="Doctor of Philosophy">PhD</abbr> next year.
        I will answer your questions one by one, in the following sections.
    </p>

    <h2>Starting dates</h2>

    <p>
        We are happy to accommodate you starting your study with us at any time,
        however it would suit us better if you could start at the beginning of a semester;
        the start dates for each one are as follows:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>First semester: <time datetime="2016-09-09">9 September 2016</time></li>
        <li>Second semester: <time datetime="2017-01-15">15 January 2017</time></li>
        <li>Third semester: <time datetime="2017-05-02">2 May 2017</time></li>
    </ul>

    <p>Please let me know if this is ok, and if so which start date you would prefer.</p>

    <h2>Subjects of study</h2>

    <p>
        At the Awesome Science Faculty, we have a pretty open-minded research facility —
        as long as the subjects fall somewhere in the realm of science and technology.
        You seem like an intelligent, <em>dedicated</em> researcher, and just the kind
        of person we'd like to have on our team.
    </p>

    <ol>
        <li>
            Turning H<sub>2</sub>O into wine, and the health benefits of Resveratrol
            (C<sub>14</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>3</sub>).
        </li>
        <li>
            Measuring the effect on performance of funk bass players at temperatures
            exceeding 30°C (86°F), when the audience size exponentially increases
            (effect of 3 × 10<sup>3</sup> increasing to 3 × 10<sup>4</sup>).
        </li>
        <li>
            <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr>,
            Hypertext Markup Language, and
            <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr>,
            Cascading Style Sheets, constructs for representing musical scores.
        </li>
    </ol>

    <p>
        So please can you provide more information on each of these subjects,
        including how long you'd expect the research to take, required staff and
        other resources, and anything else you think we'd need to know?
        <strong>Thanks.</strong>
    </p>

    <h2>Exotic dance moves</h2>

    <p>
        Yes, you are right! As part of my post-doctorate work,
        I did study exotic tribal dances. To answer your question,
        my favorite dances are as follows:
    </p>

    <dl>
        <dt>Polynesian chicken dance</dt>
        <dd>
            A little known but very influential dance dating back as far as
            300 <abbr title="Before Common Era">BCE</abbr>.
        </dd>

        <dt>Icelandic brownian shuffle</dt>
        <dd>
            Before the Icelanders developed fire as a means of getting warm,
            they used to practice this dance by huddling close together
            and shuffling rapidly.
        </dd>

        <dt>Arctic robot dance</dt>
        <dd>
            English explorers in the 1960s believed to have discovered this dance,
            but later it was found they were simply moving that way because
            they were very cold.
        </dd>
    </dl>

    <p>Yours sincerely,</p>
